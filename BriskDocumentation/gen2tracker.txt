## Running environment
	Python 2.7.12
	Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS
	OpenCV 2.4.8
	CUDA Version 7.5.18
	CUDNN 6021

## Run gen2tracker
	./darknet detector demo cfg/mio.data cfg/yolo-mio.cfg weigths/yolo-mio4.weights vidoe.mp4



## The complete tracking pipelien 
	For each object:
		1. optical flow extraction 
		2. optimal value selection 
		3. data assocation based on optical flow, object category, and object spatial positions.

	4. optical flow updating
	5. Kalman filter updating
	6. process the previous unmatched objects from previous 10 frames
	7. process the unmatched objects at current frame 

## Enable Guassian mixture model for the optimal value selection step
	Note: we want to enable an external python interpretor to create a GMM model because it is faster and more accurate
	install sklearn library: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/
	enabel PYTHON from 0 to 1 in Makefile
	make sure "#include "/usr/include/python2.7/Python.h"" is included in the beginning of objectbank.c



## Test with the Urban tracker dataset
	enable the function by switching "static int URBEN" from 0 to 1
	run the videos in the Urban tracker dataset with gen2tracker
	three output files will show up in the Urben folder
	run Urben/read.py to compile the three files into a sqlite file
	go to download the evluation metrices from: https://www.jpjodoin.com/urbantracker/dataset.html
	compare our resulst with the ground truth  



## Draw the tracking trajectory
	enable the function by switching "static int trajectoryID" from 0 to 1, and "static int trajectory" from 0 to 1
	run the video with gen2tracker
	three files will show up in table folder
	run read.py to comple the three files into a sqlite file which is in sqliteTable
	run "python pt/TI/display-traj-class.py -i /home/liqiang/AI_not_smart3/lightnet4/yolo4/opticalflow.avi -d sqliteTable/eat.sqlite"
